## User Stories

- **Title**: ATTMN

   - As a learning developer I want to use a voice command VS Code extension to build out the syntax of basic functions to avoid debugging errors. 
   - As an experienced developer I want to quickly outline the basic structure of my code without typing.
   - As a teaching developer I would like to use a voice command VS Code extension to efficiently get through lectures and demos, allowing me more time to talk through concepts and implementation.
   - As a VS Code user I would like more accessibility driven voice command extensions.
- **ACCEPTANCE TASKS:**
    -  Users of this extension will be able to use their voice to generate built in code snippets and boiler plate outlines.
- **FEATURE TASKS:**
    -  Ensures that the keyword users speak generates the intended code snippet.


## Software Requirements
VISION
- Create a voice command VS Code extension that eliminates repetive typing and generates designated code snippets based on voiced key words.
- VS Code has many features, and this project is a step in the direction to make the editor accessible to more people.
- To create a more productive work environment for programmers. This extension will increase productivity by decreasing typing time.

PAIN POINTS WE ARE SOLVING
- This project addresses the problem of writing necessary, but repetitive, code snippets.
- This project also scratches the surface of creating code editor that is not reliant on the use of a traditional keyboard.  

WHY YOU SHOULD CARE
- "Typing out a boiler plate for an Express server is only fun the first 50 times". - Arthur
- "I'm tired of typing counsole.log instead of console.log" - Taylor
